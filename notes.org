* Python
** venv is less painful than I remember
** pycache gunk was kind of annoying
* Flask
** wow, /hello is EASY
** /boom is also easy, but I wonder how I can send error messages back to the user
** for parameterized paths, path vs. string semi-typing seems weird
** implicit request object is weird
*** where does this thing come from?
*** does this mean there's no way I can multithread (or even use Python concurrency?)
*** looks like it's basically a thread-local, but in Python
**** the docs acknowledge that this can make testing hard
** the default return type is html --> echo opens up all kinds of JS injection
*** interestingly, Chrome blocks this by default
** specifying the HTTP method via a string just feels wrong
*** what does it do if I give it a garbage method?
**** it will happily execute: curl -X GARBAGE localhost:5000/incr works just as well as POST
** I like that it provides request-scoped and session-scoped storage out of the box
** it's weird to require environment variables to launch the server
*** .flaskenv helps with this, but it requires python-dotenv and the filesystem
*** why can't I use command-line arguments?
* Docker
** any setup aside from Docker for Mac is super painful
** debugging connection errors is really painful
